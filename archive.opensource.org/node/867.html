<p>Note: The Free Software Foundation, license steward of the LGPL, regards this license as having been superseded by LGPL version 3.</p>

<p>GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
Version 2, June 1991</p>

<p>Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<p>[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is<br />
numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]</p>

<p>Preamble</p>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br />
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</p>

<p>This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br />
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br />
other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for<br />
your libraries, too.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br />
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.</p>

<p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br />
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br />
you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br />
code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br />
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br />
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br />
it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>

<p>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br />
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br />
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</p>

<p>Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain<br />
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />
library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br />
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br />
the original authors' reputations.</p>

<p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br />
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br />
transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this,<br />
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's<br />
free use or not licensed at all.</p>

<p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br />
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This<br />
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br />
designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary<br />
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is<br />
the same as in the ordinary license.</p>

<p>The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br />
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br />
program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without<br />
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br />
analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in<br />
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br />
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br />
treats it as such.</p>

<p>Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br />
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br />
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We<br />
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.</p>

<p>However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br />
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br />
libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to<br />
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br />
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br />
libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve<br />
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br />
changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this<br />
will lead to faster development of free libraries.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a<br />
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The<br />
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br />
works together with the library.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br />
General Public License rather than by this special one.</p>

<p>GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>

<p>0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br />
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br />
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br />
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is<br />
addressed as "you".</p>

<p>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data<br />
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br />
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</p>

<p>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work<br />
which has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the<br />
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under<br />
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br />
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br />
straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is<br />
included without limitation in the term "modification".)</p>

<p>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />
making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means<br />
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br />
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br />
and installation of the library.</p>

<p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of<br />
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br />
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br />
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br />
writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br />
and what the program that uses the Library does.</p>

<p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br />
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br />
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br />
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br />
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br />
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br />
Library.</p>

<p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br />
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br />
fee.</p>

<p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br />
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br />
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<p>a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</p>

<p>b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br />
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>

<p>c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br />
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>

<p>d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br />
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br />
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br />
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br />
in the event an application does not supply such function or<br />
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br />
its purpose remains meaningful.</p>

<p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br />
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br />
application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br />
application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br />
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br />
root function must still compute square roots.)</p>

<p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If<br />
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br />
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you<br />
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br />
it.</p>

<p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />
collective works based on the Library.</p>

<p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br />
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br />
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />
the scope of this License.</p>

<p>3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br />
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do<br />
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br />
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br />
instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br />
that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in<br />
these notices.</p>

<p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br />
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br />
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</p>

<p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br />
the Library into a program that is not a library.</p>

<p>4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br />
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br />
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br />
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br />
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br />
medium customarily used for software interchange.</p>

<p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br />
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br />
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br />
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br />
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>

<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br />
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br />
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a<br />
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br />
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</p>

<p>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library<br />
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br />
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the<br />
library". The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br />
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</p>

<p>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file<br />
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br />
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br />
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br />
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The<br />
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.</p>

<p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br />
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br />
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br />
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br />
work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br />
Library will still fall under Section 6.)</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br />
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br />
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br />
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.</p>

<p>6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br />
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a<br />
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br />
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br />
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br />
engineering for debugging such modifications.</p>

<p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br />
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br />
this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work<br />
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br />
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br />
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one<br />
of these things:</p>

<p>a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br />
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br />
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br />
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br />
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that<br />
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the<br />
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br />
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood<br />
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br />
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br />
to use the modified definitions.)</p>

<p>b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br />
least three years, to give the same user the materials<br />
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br />
than the cost of performing this distribution.</p>

<p>c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br />
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br />
specified materials from the same place.</p>

<p>d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br />
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</p>

<p>For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the<br />
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for<br />
reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,<br />
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br />
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br />
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br />
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br />
the executable.</p>

<p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br />
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br />
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot<br />
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br />
distribute.</p>

<p>7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br />
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br />
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br />
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br />
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br />
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:</p>

<p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br />
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br />
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the<br />
Sections above.</p>

<p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br />
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br />
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>

<p>8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br />
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any<br />
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br />
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br />
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,<br />
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br />
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>

<p>9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />
signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />
distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are<br />
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by<br />
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br />
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />
the Library or works based on it.</p>

<p>10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br />
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br />
subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further<br />
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />
this License.</p>

<p>11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot<br />
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />
may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent<br />
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br />
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.</p>

<p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br />
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br />
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />
integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br />
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made<br />
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />
impose that choice.</p>

<p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />
be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

<p>12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br />
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br />
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br />
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br />
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br />
written in the body of this License.</p>

<p>13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br />
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br />
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br />
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library<br />
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br />
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and<br />
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br />
the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a<br />
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br />
the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br />
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br />
write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is<br />
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br />
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our<br />
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br />
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br />
and reuse of software generally.</p>

<p>NO WARRANTY</p>

<p>15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br />
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br />
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br />
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br />
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br />
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br />
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<p>16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br />
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br />
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br />
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br />
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br />
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br />
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br />
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br />
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br />
DAMAGES.</p>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</p>

<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br />
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting<br />
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br />
ordinary General Public License).</p>

<p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is<br />
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br />

    <h2>To promote and protect open source software and communities...</h2>
  
  <div class="content">
    <p><span style="color:#ffffff;">For </span><a href="https://opensource.org/history"><span style="color:#428bca;">over 20 years</span></a><span style="color:#ffffff;"> the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has worked to raise awareness and adoption of open source software, and build bridges between </span><a href="https://opensource.org/affiliates"><span style="color:#428bca;">open source communities</span></a><span style="color:#ffffff;"> of practice. As a </span><a href="https://opensource.org/sponsors#sponOps"><span style="color:#428bca;">global non-profit</span></a><span style="color:#ffffff;">, the OSI champions software freedom in society through education, collaboration, and infrastructure, stewarding the </span><a href="https://opensource.org/osd"><span style="color:#428bca;">Open Source Definition</span></a><span style="color:#ffffff;"> (OSD), and preventing abuse of the ideals and ethos inherent to the open source movement.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#ffffff;">Open source software is made by </span><a href="https://opensource.org/members"><span style="color:#428bca;">many people</span></a><span style="color:#ffffff;"> and distributed under an </span><a href="https://opensource.org/licenses"><span style="color:#428bca;">OSD-compliant license</span></a><span style="color:#ffffff;"> which grants all the rights to use, study, change, and share the software in modified and unmodified form. Software freedom is essential to enabling community development of open source software.</span></p>
