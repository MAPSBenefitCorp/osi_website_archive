<p>THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ADAPTIVE PUBLIC LICENSE ("<strong>LICENSE</strong>"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE LICENSED WORK CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE AND ITS TERMS, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH RECIPIENT READS THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. "LICENSED WORK" AND "RECIPIENT" ARE DEFINED BELOW.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: This License is "adaptive", and the generic version or another version of an Adaptive Public License should not be relied upon to determine your rights and obligations under this License.

<p><strong>2. LICENSE.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>2.1. COPYRIGHT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(a)</b> Subject to the terms of this License, the Initial Contributor hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(i)</b> reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Initial Work; and</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Subject to the terms of this License, each Subsequent Contributor hereby grants each Recipient a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive copyright license to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(i)</b> reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Subsequent Work of such Subsequent Contributor; and</p>

<p><b>(ii)</b> reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute, and sublicense any derivative works (if any) prepared by Recipient;</p>
</blockquote>
in Source Code and Executable form, either with other Modifications, on an unmodified basis, or as part of a Larger Work.</blockquote>

<p><strong>2.2. PATENT LICENSE FROM INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTORS.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(a)</b> This License does not include or grant any patent license whatsoever from the Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or any Distributor unless, at the time the Initial Work is first distributed or made available under this License (as the case may be), the Initial Contributor has selected pursuant to <strong>Part 6 of Exhibit A</strong> the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from <strong>Part 6 of Exhibit A</strong>. If this is not done then the Initial Work and any other Subsequent Work is made available under the License without any patent license (the "<strong>PATENTS-EXCLUDED LICENSE</strong>").</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> However, the Initial Contributor may subsequently distribute or make available (as the case may be) future copies of: (1) the Initial Work; or (2) any Licensed Work distributed by the Initial Contributor which includes the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) and/or any Modification made by the Initial Contributor; available under a License which includes a patent license (the "<strong>PATENTS-INCLUDED LICENSE</strong>") by selecting pursuant to <strong>Part 6 of Exhibit A</strong> the patent terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from <strong>Part 6 of Exhibit A</strong>, when the Initial Contributor distributes or makes available (as the case may be) such future copies under this License.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> If any Recipient receives or obtains one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under the Patents-Included License, then all licensing of such copies under this License shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from <strong>Part 6 of Exhibit A</strong> and that Recipient shall not be able to rely upon the Patents-Excluded License for any such copies. However, all Recipients that receive one or more copies of the Initial Work or any other portion of the Licensed Work under a copy of the License which includes the Patents-Excluded License shall have no patent license with respect to such copies received under the Patents-Excluded License and availability and distribution of such copies, including Modifications made by such Recipient to such copies, shall be under a copy of the License without any patent license.</p>

<p><b>(d)</b> Where a Recipient uses in combination or combines any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Excluded License with any copy of the Licensed Work (or portion thereof) licensed under a copy of the License having a Patents-Included License, the combination (and any portion thereof) shall, from the first time such Recipient uses, makes available or distributes the combination (as the case may be), be subject to only the terms of the License having the Patents-Included License which shall include the terms in paragraphs A, B, C, D and E from <strong>Part 6 of Exhibit A</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="c1"><strong>2.3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND DISCLAIMER.</strong></p>

<p>Recipient understands and agrees that although Initial Contributor and each Subsequent Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no representation, warranty, guarantee or assurance is provided by any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor that the Licensed Work does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, and each Distributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the Licensed Works. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Licensed Work, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Licensed Work.</p>

<p><strong>2.4. RESERVATION.</strong></p>

<p>Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, or Distributor except as expressly stated herein.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>3.1. DISTRIBUTION GENERALLY.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(a)</b> A Subsequent Contributor shall make that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work(s) available to the public via an Electronic Distribution Mechanism for a period of at least twelve (12) months. The aforesaid twelve (12) month period shall begin within a reasonable time after the creation of the Subsequent Work and no later than sixty (60) days after first distribution of that Subsequent Contributor's Subsequent Work.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> All Distributors must distribute the Licensed Work in accordance with the terms of the License, and must include a copy of this License (including without limitation Exhibit A and the accompanying Supplement File) with each copy of the Licensed Work distributed. In particular, this License must be prominently distributed with the Licensed Work in a file called "license.txt." In addition, the License Notice in <strong>Part 5 of Exhibit A</strong> must be included at the beginning of all Source Code files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the License Notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the Licensed Work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3.2. EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTIONS OF THE LICENSED WORK.</strong></p>

<p>A Distributor may choose to distribute the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, in Executable form (an "<strong>EXECUTABLE DISTRIBUTION</strong>") to any third party, under the terms of Section 2 of this License, provided the Executable Distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this License, AND provided at least ONE of the following conditions is fulfilled:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(a)</b> The Executable Distribution must be accompanied by the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, and the Source Code must be distributed on the same media as the Executable Distribution or using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism; or</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The Executable Distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six (36) months, to give any third party under the terms of this License, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the Source Code for the Licensed Work making up the Executable Distribution, to be available and distributed using an Electronic Distribution Mechanism, and such Executable Distribution must remain available in Source Code form to any third party via the Electronic Distribution Mechanism (or any replacement Electronic Distribution Mechanism the particular Distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute) for said at least thirty six (36) months.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For greater certainty, the above-noted requirements apply to any Licensed Work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in Executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a Larger Work or Independent Modules, or in some other combination.</p>

<p><strong>3.3. SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTIONS.</strong></p>

<p>When a Distributor makes the Licensed Work, or any portion thereof, available to any Person in Source Code form, it must be made available under this License and a copy of this License must be included with each copy of the Source Code, situated so that the copy of the License is conspicuously brought to the attention of that Person. For greater clarification, this Section 3.3 applies to all distribution of the Licensed Work in any Source Code form. A Distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution.</p>

<p><strong>3.4. REQUIRED NOTICES IN SOURCE CODE.</strong></p>

<p>Each Subsequent Contributor must ensure that the notice set out in <strong>Part 5 of Exhibit A</strong> is included in each file of the Source Code for each Subsequent Work originating from that particular Subsequent Contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then the Subsequent Contributor must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.</p>

<p><strong>3.5. NO DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNALLY USED MODIFICATIONS.</strong></p>

<p>Notwithstanding Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, Recipient may, internally within its own corporation or organization use the Licensed Work, including the Initial Work and Subsequent Works, and make Modifications for internal use within Recipient's own corporation or organization (collectively, "<strong>INTERNAL USE MODIFICATIONS</strong>"). The Recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either Source Code or Executable form, any such Internal Use Modifications made by Recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this Section 3.5. All Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Person, whether or not a Third Party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this License. If the Recipient chooses to distribute any such Internal Use Modifications to any Third Party, then the Recipient shall be deemed a Subsequent Contributor, and any such Internal Use Modifications distributed to any Third Party shall be deemed a Subsequent Work originating from that Subsequent Contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the Licensed Work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of Sections 3.1 to 3.4 inclusive.</p>

<p><strong>3.6. INDEPENDENT MODULES.</strong></p>

<p>This License shall not apply to Independent Modules of any Initial Contributor, Subsequent Contributor, Distributor or any Recipient, and such Independent Modules may be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements.</p>

<p><strong>3.7. LARGER WORKS.</strong></p>

<p>Any Distributor or Recipient may create or contribute to a Larger Work by combining any of the Licensed Work with other code not governed by the terms of this License, and may distribute the Larger Work as one or more products. However, in any such case, Distributor or Recipient (as the case may be) must make sure that the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Licensed Work portion of the Larger Work.</p>

<p><strong>3.8. DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(a)</b> Each Subsequent Contributor (including the Initial Contributor where the Initial Contributor also qualifies as a Subsequent Contributor) must cause each Subsequent Work created or contributed to by that Subsequent Contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements of <strong>Part 1 of the Supplement File</strong>, that such Subsequent Contributor made in the creation or contribution to that Subsequent Work. If no Supplement File exists or no requirements are set out in <strong>Part 1 of the Supplement File</strong>, then there are no requirements for Subsequent Contributors to document changes that they make resulting in Subsequent Works.</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> The Initial Contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements (in each case, the "<strong>EARLIER DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS</strong>") for documenting changes resulting in Subsequent Works by revising <strong>Part 1</strong> of each copy of the Supplement File distributed by the Initial Contributor with future copies of the Licensed Work so that <strong>Part 1</strong> then contains new requirements (the "<strong>NEW DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS</strong>") for documenting such changes.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> Any Recipient receiving at any time any copy of an Initial Work or any Subsequent Work under a copy of this License (in each case, an "Earlier <b>LICENSED COPY</b>") having the Earlier Description Requirements may choose, with respect to each such Earlier Licensed Copy, to comply with the Earlier Description Requirements or the New Description Requirements. Where a Recipient chooses to comply with the New Description Requirements, that Recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such Earlier Licensed Copy, include a Supplement File having a section entitled <b>Part 1</b> that contains a copy of the New Description Requirements.</p>

<p><b>(d)</b> For greater certainty, the intent of <b>Part 1 of the Supplement File</b> is to provide a mechanism (if any) by which Subsequent Contributors must document changes that they make to the Licensed Work resulting in Subsequent Works. <b>Part 1 of any Supplement File</b> shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in Article 2 of this License or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any Recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the License. Further, a Recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with <b>Part 1 of the Supplement File</b>, but cannot be penalised with damages. <b>Part 1 of any Supplement Fil</b>e is only binding on each Recipient of any Licensed Work to the extent <b>Part 1</b> sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work.</p>

<p><b>(e)</b> An example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by Subsequent Contributor is set out in <b>Part 7 of Exhibit A</b> of this License. <b>Part 7</b> is a sample only and is not binding on Recipients, unless (subject to the earlier paragraphs of this Section 3.8) those are the requirements that the Initial Contributor includes in <b>Part 1 of the Supplement File</b> with the copies of the Initial Work distributed under this License.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="c1"><strong>3.9. USE OF DISTRIBUTOR NAME.</strong></p>

<p>The name of a Distributor may not be used by any other Distributor to endorse or promote the Licensed Work or products derived from the Licensed Work, without prior written permission.</p>

<p class="c1"><strong>3.10. LIMITED RECOGNITION OF INITIAL CONTRIBUTOR.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(a)</b> As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may include in <b>Part 2 of the Supplement File</b> a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur (the "<b>ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION</b>"). The Attribution Information must be included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL (collectively, the "<b>ATTRIBUTION LIMITS</b>").</p>

<p><b>(b)</b> If no Supplement File exists, or no Attribution Information is set out in <b>Part 2 of the Supplement File</b>, then there are no requirements for Recipients to display any Attribution Information of the Initial Contributor.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> Each Recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and/or trade names contained within <b>Part 2 of the Supplement File</b> distributed with the Licensed Work are the exclusive property of the Initial Contributor and may only be used with the permission of the Initial Contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this License.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3.11.</strong> For greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a Supplement File may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution requirements, as the case may be. Any provision in a Supplement File that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="c1"><strong>4. COMMERCIAL USE AND INDEMNITY.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="c1"><strong>4.1. COMMERCIAL SERVICES.</strong></p>

<p>A Recipient ("<b>COMMERCIAL RECIPIENT</b>") may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations (collectively, "<b>SERVICES</b>") to one or more other Recipients or Distributors. However, such Commercial Recipient may do so only on that Commercial Recipient's own behalf, and not on behalf of any other Distributor or Recipient, and Commercial Recipient must make it clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation(s) is/are offered by Commercial Recipient alone. At no time may Commercial Recipient use any Services to deny any party the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this License. For greater certainty, this Section 4.1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this License, including without limitation the obligation of the Commercial Recipient as a Distributor, when distributing any of the Licensed Work in Source Code or Executable form, to make such distribution royalty-free (subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing Source Code or Executable distribution (as the case may be)).</p>

<p class="c1"><strong>4.2. INDEMNITY.</strong></p>

<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this License is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Licensed Work, the Distributor who includes any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Distributors. Therefore, if a Distributor includes the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or offers any Services, such Distributor ("<b>COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTOR</b>") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Distributor or Subsequent Contributor (in each case an "<b>INDEMNIFIED PARTY</b>") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "<b>LOSSES</b>") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the Licensed Work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any Services. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Party must: (a) promptly notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim; and (b) allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and co-operate with the Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Party may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="c1"><strong>5. VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="c1"><strong>5.1. NEW VERSIONS.</strong></p>

<p>The Initial Contributor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</p>

<p class="c1"><strong>5.2. EFFECT OF NEW VERSIONS.</strong></p>

<p>Once the Licensed Work or any portion thereof has been published by Initial Contributor under a particular version of the License, Recipient may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version. However, if a Recipient chooses to use the Licensed Work under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the Initial Contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the Recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the Recipient in connection with the Licensed Work. No one other than the Initial Contributor has the right to modify the terms applicable to the Licensed Work</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="c1"><strong>6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="c1"><strong>6.1. GENERAL DISCLAIMER.</strong></p>

<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS LICENSE, THE LICENSED WORK IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, GUARANTEE, ASSURANCE OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH RECIPIENT.

			<td width="60">[      ]</td>
		</tr><tr><td>NO</td>
			<td>[      ]</td>
		</tr></tbody></table></blockquote>

<p>By default, if YES is not selected by the Initial Contributor, the answer is NO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>A.</b> For the purposes of the paragraphs in this Part 6 of Exhibit A, "<b>LICENSABLE</b>" means having the right to grant, to the maximum extent possible, whether at the time of the initial grant or subsequently acquired, any and all of the rights granted herein.</p>

<p><b>B.</b> The Initial Contributor hereby grants all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s) Licensable by the Initial Contributor that are or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of such Initial Work or any portion thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph B by the Initial Contributor: (1) for any code that the Initial Contributor deletes from the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Initial Contributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Initial Work (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Initial Work (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Initial Contributor.</p>

<p><b>C.</b> Effective upon distribution by a Subsequent Contributor to a Third Party of any Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor, such Subsequent Contributor hereby grants all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s) Licensable by such Subsequent Contributor that are or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of any such Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor alone and/or in combination with its Subsequent Work (or portions of such combination) to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, export, transfer and otherwise dispose of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>(1)</b> Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor (or portions thereof); and</p>

<p><b>(2)</b> the combination of Modifications made by that Subsequent Contributor with its Subsequent Work (or portions of such combination);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(collectively and in each case, the "<b>SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTOR VERSION</b>").</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph C by such Subsequent Contributor: (1) for any code that such Subsequent Contributor deletes from the Subsequent Contributor Version (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Subsequent Contributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Subsequent Contributor Version (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Subsequent Contributor Version (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Subsequent Contributor.</p>

<p><b>D.</b> Effective upon distribution of any Licensed Work by a Distributor to a Third Party, such Distributor hereby grants all Recipients a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims, under patent claim(s) Licensable by such Distributor that are or would be infringed by the making, using, selling, offering for sale, having made, importing, exporting, transfer or disposal of any such Licensed Work distributed by such Distributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, export, transfer and otherwise dispose of such Licensed Work or portions thereof (collectively and in each case, the "<b>DISTRIBUTOR VERSION</b>"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no patent license is granted under this Paragraph D by such Distributor: (1) for any code that such Distributor deletes from the Distributor Version (or any portion thereof) distributed by the Distributor prior to such distribution; (2) for any Modifications made to the Distributor Version (or any portion thereof) by any other Person; or (3) separate from the Distributor Version (or portions thereof) distributed or made available by the Distributor.</p>

<p><b>E.</b> If Recipient institutes patent litigation against another Recipient (a "<b>USER</b>") with respect to a patent applicable to a computer program or software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit, and whether or not any of the patent claims are directed to a system, method, process, apparatus, device, product, article of manufacture or any other form of patent claim), then any patent or copyright license granted by that User to such Recipient under this License or any other copy of this License shall terminate. The termination shall be effective ninety (90) days after notice of termination from User to Recipient, unless the Recipient withdraws the patent litigation claim before the end of the ninety (90) day period. To be effective, any such notice of license termination must include a specific list of applicable patents and/or a copy of the copyrighted work of User that User alleges will be infringed by Recipient upon License termination. License termination is only effective with respect to patents and/or copyrights for which proper notice has been given.</p>

<p class="c1">PART 7: SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DESCRIPTION OF DISTRIBUTED MODIFICATIONS</p>
